= Intermediate result of the TicTacToe kata using classic TDD with functional programming in Kotlin

* Kata
** https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog/tree/master/Tic%20Tac%20Toe
* Idea
** After I did the kata in a mob programmin session using the object oriented programming style and Java,
I wanted to try classic TDD in combination with the functional programming style and Kotlin

Findings

* The approach with classic TDD and functional programming worked fine
* Kotlin works well to implement the code in the functional style with
functions and immutable state (I used data classes with val, immutable maps, ...)

Watch out

* Kotlin (as Scala) does not support pure functional programming (like Haskell, ELM)
so it is up to you and your discipline to not pollute the solution with some accidental side-effects
* This is just an intermediate result
** the solution is not finished
** not all functional calisthenics (and object calisthenics) are respected
