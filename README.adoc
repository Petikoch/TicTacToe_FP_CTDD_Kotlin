= Intermediate result of the TicTacToe kata using classic TDD with functional programming in Kotlin

* Kata
** https://github.com/AgileTechPraxis/katalog/tree/master/Tic%20Tac%20Toe
* Approach to find a solution
** Use classic TDD (no mocking...)
** Use functional programming
** Use Kotlin
* Idea
** Find out how well this fits together
** Create a simple version which can actually be played using the console

Findings

* The approach worked fine
* Kotlin works well to implement
** the code in a functional style
** immutable state (I used data classes with val, immutable maps, ...)

Watch out

* Kotlin (as Scala) does not support pure functional programming (like Haskell, ELM)
so it is up to you and your discipline to not pollute the solution with some accidental side-effects
